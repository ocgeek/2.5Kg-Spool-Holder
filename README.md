# Spool-Holders

This repo contains files for printing and building spool holders which are planned to sit on the top of the printer
* 2.5Kg spool holder
* 1Kg spool holder

If you are thinking about building a big spool holder for your printer you are in the right place

The 1Kg spool holder is composed by two parts.
One arm holder which is fixed (bolted to top frame) to the top of the printer
A put in place as you need arm with bearings for the 1Kg spools

This allows to have the flexibility to load either spools as needed without changing the configuration

The 2.5KG Spool Holder has been succesfully tested with :
* eSun 2.5Kg Spools
* 3DJake 2.3Kg Spools

I used F625-2RS berings as guides for the spool
